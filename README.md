# Instructions 

## Details
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

Recommend using [Node 18.12.1 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run node based server.

## Set Up

Make sure your terminal is in the **post-excerise** directory
```console
..\NitroAssignment\posts-excerise
```

Once in the correct directory run npm install (or yarn equivalent) to install required dependencies
```console
npm install
```

When the dependencies have finished installing you can run the application. 

First run the node server with the following command. The server will run on port 3000. If you need to change the port modify the port variable in the server.js file.
```console
npm run start:server
```

To run the angular front end run the following command. The frontend will run on port 4200. If you need to change it you can change start:port script in the package.json and run that command.
```console
npm run start
```
or
```console
npm run start:port
```

Angular CLI will output the URL to view the web app. Usually http://localhost:4200/
```console
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
```

## Running Tests
```console
npm run test
```
